# US-MEX Border crossing times and lane openings

I'm continuing to mess around with Svelte and decided to build a border crossing time web page from a RSS feed at https://bwt.cbp.gov/. 

Some things I should revisit if I ever continue to work on this project:

- [ ] Mobile support
- [ ] Review the XML parsing to handle all edge cases that will break it
